		<h2>Python Projects</h2>
		<h3>Unit 1</h3>
		<p>
			<img src="images/PythonScreenShot1.PNG"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<p> Description: <br></br> In our first Python unit, we learned how to use basic commands in Python, like print statements, and mathematical operations (addition, subtraction etc)</p>
		<br></br>
		<p>Concepts learned:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Print statements- We learned how to make Python print out whatever you want it to "say"</li>
			<li> Mathematical operations- We learned how to perform basic mathematical functions in python. </li>
			<li> Variables- We learned how to program variables into python to keep track of changing numbers. 
			<li> Classes and Pygame- We learned how to create class objects and how to run Pygame (to a basic degree)
		</ul>
		<h3>Unit 2</h3>
		<p>
			<img src="images/PythonScreenShot2.PNG"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<p> Description: <br></br> In the second unit, we learned how to create classes and use pygame to create simple games.</p>
		<br></br>
		<p>Concepts learned:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Classes- We learned how to create and utilize classes in Python, specifically in Pygame.</p>
			<li>Pygame- We learned how to utilize classes and images to create games. We learned how to make objects detect collision as well, and how to use variables to keep track of situations (winning, losing, score, etc.)
			<li>Collision- We learned how to add collision into our games and how to detect collision</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Unit 3</h3>
		<p>
			<img src="images/PythonScreenShot3.PNG"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<p> Description: <br></br> During the course of the third unit, we dove even deeper into pygame code. We learned to utilize variables and pygame to create timers, and we learned how to use pygame's built in random number generator. </p>
		<br></br>
		<p>Concepts learned:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>RNG (random number generator)- While its not truly random (psuedo random number generator) it allows for random number generation for games, such as moving a gem to a random location, or generating randomized terrain.</li>
			<li>Variables (cont)- We have already learned to use variables but we continued to learn even more about them, including how to make timers and counters for games.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Unit 4</h3>
		<p>
			<img src="images/PythonScreenShot4.PNG"/ width="400" height="300">
		</p>
		<p>Description: <br></br> By the end of Unit 4 we had learned how to use lists, for loops, and while loops. These allowed us to perform many actions normally unable to us, allowing even better game function.</p>
		<br></br>
		<p>Concepts learned:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Lists- We used lists to keep track of large groups of things, like enemies, or costumes.</li>
			<li>Loops- We have learned some basic loops previously, but we learned how to use for and while loops with even greater effect.</li>
		</ul>
